The arginine vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) plays an important role in social behaviors
including social learning, memory, and aggression, and is known to be a specific marker for the
cornu ammonis area 2 (CA2) regions of the hippocampus. The fasciola cinereum (FC) is an
anatomical region in which Avpr1b expressing neurons are prominent, but the functional roles of
the FC have yet to be investigated. Surprisingly, the FC is absent in the inbred BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR)
mouse strain used to study core behavioral deficits of autism. Here, we characterized and compared
transcriptomic expression profiles using single nucleus RNA sequencing and identified 7 different
subpopulations and heterogeneity within the dorsal CA2 (dCA2) and FC. Mef2c, involved in
autism spectrum disorder, is more highly expressed in the FC. Using Hiplex in situ hybridization,
we examined the neuroanatomical locations of these subpopulations in the proximal and distal
regions of the hippocampus. Anterograde tracing of Avpr1b neurons specific for the FC showed
projections to the IG, dCA2, lacunosum molecular layer of CA1, dorsal fornix, septofibrial nuclei,
and intermediate lateral septum (iLS). In contrast to the dCA2, inhibition of Avpr1b neurons in
the FC by the inhibitory DREADD system during behavioral testing did not impair social memory.
We performed single nucleus RNA sequencing in the dCA2 region and compared between
wildtype (WT) and BTBR mice. We found that transcriptomic profiles of dCA2 neurons between
BTBR and WT mice are very similar as they did not form any unique clusters; yet, we found there
were differentially expressed genes between the dCA2s of BTBR and WT mice. Overall, this is a
comprehensive study of the comparison of Avpr1b neuronal subpopulations between the FC and
dCA2. The fact that FC is absent in BTBR mice, a mouse model for autism spectrum disorder,
suggests that the FC may play a role in understanding neuropsychiatric disease.
